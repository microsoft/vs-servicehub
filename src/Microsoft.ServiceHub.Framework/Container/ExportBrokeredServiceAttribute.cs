	/// so that it can only be *directly* acquired by owners. However, this is not sufficient to prevent unauthorized access.
	/// If Service B is proffered with <see cref="ServiceAudience.AllClientsIncludingGuests"/>,
	/// it can be *directly* acquired by guests. When Service B internally acquires an instance of Service A, this means that guests now have
	/// *indirect* access to the sensitive operations in Service A. If Service A has not implemented authorization to guard sensitive operations,
	/// this indirect access violates the security boundary.</para>
	///
	/// <para>In order to prevent untrusted parties transitively aquiring a service that should require authorization,
	/// by default all brokered services are only accessible to owners. This is regardless of the value of <see cref="Audience"/>.
	/// In the example above, if Service B has been aquired by a guest, the attempt to acquire Service A will fail.</para>
