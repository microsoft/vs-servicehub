# ISB001 Dispose of proxies

Proxies obtained from `IServiceBroker.GetProxyAsync<T>` must always be disposed of.
Until they are explicitly disposed of, I/O resources are allocated to them that will not be released naturally by the garbage collector.
Although the interface `T` returned from this method does not clearly implement `IDisposable`, the proxy instance returned does in fact implement `IDisposable`.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

The following code acquires and uses a proxy to a brokered service but does not dispose of it.
This generates a diagnostic.

```cs
IMyService client = await serviceBroker.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor);
if (client is object)
{
    await client.FooAsync();
}
```

In another example, the proxy is stored in a member (field or property) instead of a local variable.
This is wrong both because `this.client` must be disposed of in a `Dispose` method and because `this.client` should be disposed of before being reassigned:

```cs
class MyClass
{
    IMyService client;

    async Task DoSomethingAsync()
    {
        this.client = await serviceBroker.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor);
        if (this.client is object)
        {
            await this.client.FooAsync();
        }
    }
}
```

## Solution

Fix the error by ensuring that the proxy gets disposed of.

When the proxy is stored in a local variable, use a `using` block:

```cs
using (IMyService client = await serviceBroker.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor))
{
    if (client is object)
    {
        await client.FooAsync();
    }
}
```

If `IMyService` does not derive from `IDisposable`, use this syntax:

```cs
IMyService client = await serviceBroker.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor);
using (client as IDisposable)
{
    if (client is object)
    {
        await client.FooAsync();
    }
}
```

When the proxy is stored in a member, dispose of it before any reassignment, and in the Dispose method:

```cs
class MyClass : IDisposable
{
    IMyService client;

    async Task DoSomethingAsync()
    {
        (this.client as IDisposable)?.Dispose();
        this.client = await serviceBroker.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor);
        if (this.client is object)
        {
            await this.client.FooAsync();
        }
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        (this.client as IDisposable)?.Dispose();
    }
}
```
