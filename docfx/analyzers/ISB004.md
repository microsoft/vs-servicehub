# ISB004 Optional interfaces on exported brokered services are implemented

When a type is annotated with the `[ExportBrokeredService]` attribute, it may provide a list of optional interfaces that clients may also use.

All interfaces in the list must be implemented by the type.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

The following code generates a diagnostic.

```cs
[ExportBrokeredService("name", "1.0", typeof(IBar))] // IBar isn't actually implemented by the Foo class.
class Foo : IExportedBrokeredService, IFoo
{
}
```

## Solution

Fix the error by implementing the `IBar` interface.

```cs
[ExportBrokeredService("name", "1.0", typeof(IBar))]
class Foo : IExportedBrokeredService, IFoo, IBar
{
}
```

Or remove the `IBar` interface from the list of optional interfaces.

```cs
[ExportBrokeredService("name", "1.0")]
class Foo : IExportedBrokeredService, IFoo
{
}
```
