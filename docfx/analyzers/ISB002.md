# ISB002 Avoid storing rentals in fields

Proxies obtained from `ServiceBrokerClient.GetProxyAsync<T>` should be used and disposed of within a single async method.
This allows the `ServiceBrokerClient` to manage proxy lifetimes.

If proxies need to be held for longer than an async method, use the `IServiceBroker` interface instead of `ServiceBrokerClient`.

## Examples of patterns that are flagged by this analyzer

The following code acquires and uses a proxy to a brokered service and stores the rental in a field.
This generates a diagnostic.

```cs
class Foo
{
    ServiceBrokerClient serviceBrokerClient;
    ServiceBrokerClient.Rental<IMyService> proxyRental;

    async Task DoSomethingAsync()
    {
        proxyRental = await serviceBrokerClient.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor);
    }
}
```

## Solution

Fix the error by using the rental only within the async method:

```cs
class Foo
{
    ServiceBrokerClient serviceBrokerClient;

    async Task DoSomethingAsync()
    {
        using (var proxyRental = await serviceBrokerClient.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor))
        {
            if (proxyRental.Proxy is object)
            {
                // use proxyRental.Proxy here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Or if you need to manage the proxy lifetime beyond the async method, use `IServiceBroker` instead:

```cs
class Foo : IDisposable
{
    IServiceBroker serviceBroker;
    IMyService? proxy;

    async Task DoSomethingAsync()
    {
        if (proxy is null)
        {
            proxy = await serviceBroker.GetProxyAsync<IMyService>(someDescriptor);
        }
        
        if (proxy is object)
        {
            // use proxy here
        }
    }

    public void Dispose() => (proxy as IDisposable)?.Dispose();
}
```
